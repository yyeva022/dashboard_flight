# R Shiny Dashboard for Flight Delay Dataset (Kaggle)

Dashboard: https://yyeva022.shinyapps.io/flight/

## About Dashboard
I created a dashboard using flight delay dataset (from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/data), to illustrate how R shiny can create a dashboard that can be used in day-to-day business scenario, delivering KPI performance for different stakeholders as per their needs.

- Select the conditions (e.g. timeframe, airline) to get the KPI performance accordingly
- Track data in time sequence, and drill up and down for monthly/daily level
- Compare the performance (as heatmap) in different regions 

Version 2.0 is coming, including

- Directly click on chart to drill up/down
- Prediction: input the airline, date of flight, destination city etc to estimate the delay rate

## About R Shiny

- Free: free to use once you download shiny package in R
- Simple: no web development skills required
- Interactive: dynamic visualization that can react to user input
- Flexible: easily to manipulate data for visulization, or even can incoporate prediction modeling to show predicted results
